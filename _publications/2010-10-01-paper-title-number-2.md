excerpt: 'As the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the
United States, many people were left with questions regarding
this novel disease. When few reliable sources were available,
many turned to social media for information. Individuals reached
out to online health communities to learn more about many
aspects of the condition like symptoms, treatments, prognosis,
and management of the disease. This study examines the informational exchange between users in an online health community
during the first three months of the lockdown in the United
States. Using social network analysis, we aim to characterize
the informational exchange between users in a number of
topics. Due to COVID-19 being a novel health condition, we
observe only informational exchanges between users. Information
seeking topics identified in the data were public health practice
and psychological impacts, symptoms, health risk, transmission,
management, prognosis, prevention, and protocol. We form a
graph for each type of information seeking exchange. We use
different metrics extracted from each information seeking graph
to characterize the interaction between the users. Using these
metrics, we can provide insight on how each type of information
seeking differs for users of COVID-19 related online health
communities as well as how social media networks can better serve their users in times of health uncertainty.'
